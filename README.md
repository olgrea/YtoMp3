# MyYoutubeNow
Downloads and converts a video or playlist to mp3 

`MyYoutubeNow.exe <videoOrPlaylistUrl>`
 
If the video has chapters (such as music albums or mixes), you can add the `-s` switch to split it into chapters

`MyYoutubeNow.exe <videoUrl> -s`

Chapters are parsed directly from the watch page, either from the chapters metadata or from the video description. 

Only compatible with Windows 64 bit.
